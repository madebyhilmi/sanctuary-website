							<h2>Beautiful iOS Design</h2>
							<p>Apollo was built from the beginning to look and feel like a gorgeous, immediately familiar iOS app, following the design guidelines Apple put forward. Essentially, the goal was to envision what a Reddit app would look like if Apple themselves built it. The design was meticulously sculpted and refined over years, always making sure the UI felt comfortable and distinctly iOS, and with all the power, speed and flexibility you could possibly want.</p>

							<h2>Incredibly Simple and Intuitive</h2>
							<p>Viewing media is at the heart of what makes Reddit so awesome, so you need a Media Viewer that's absolutely top notch. With Apollo, you can view tons of content from numerous sources such as Imgur, Reddit, Gfycat, Imgflip, XKCD, Streamable, YouTube, Vimeo, and more. View images, albums, HTML5 GIFs (with time-scrubbing), videos and more in an incredible, content-first media experience.</p>

							<p>Reading fascinating conversations in the comments of Reddit threads is where a lot of us spend most of our time on Reddit, so it has to be a fundamentally incredible experience. With awesome inline previews of links in comments, customizable gestures with swipe to collapse, full spoiler support, and tons of more options available via long-press, Apollo offers the best comment browsing experience in town.</p>

							<h2>Easy to Setup and Fine-tune</h2>
							<p>Reddit takes full advantage of Markdown, a really effortless way to format text with bold, italics, links, and much more. On mobile, it's never been easy to take advantage of these formatting features, but with Apollo you can let its Markdown editor do all the formatting and previewing for you so you can just focus on writing. Easy inline image and album uploads, too!</p>
