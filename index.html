							<h2>Beautiful Design</h2>
							<p>Sanctuary was built from the ground up to be a gorgeous App, immediately familiar to everyone who uses iOS apps. We spent hours improving our desing in Sketch, pouring over everything from the logo to our colour scheme. We wanted to provide the users with clean and simple user interface that was non-obtrusive and left them feeling at home on the app. The user interface is there to help guide the user, but get out of their way and allow them to focus on building real authentic connection with potential romatic prospects.</p>

							<h2>Incredibly Simple and Intuitive</h2>
							<p>Sanctuary behaves exactly as you would expect any other application to behave. Following established standards for features like chat, it's simple, intuititve and easy to use. It's goal is to get out of your way and let you focus on building roots in your new relationship, but it's there to provide some help if needed. Finding your new life partner is as simple as tapping the screen and letting our matching algorithm pair you with someone we think you'll hit it off with. Don't worry, if you aren't feeling it you can unmatch and move on to the next potential life partner. ;)</p>

							<h2>Build Authentic Relationships</h2>
							<p>Dating is hard. In a world where technology is at an all time high, finding the one hasn’t become any easier. The challenge is that as awesome as dating applications, blind dates and sliding in people’s DMs is - it doesn’t make finding someone any easier.  
								In a world filled with technology, leveraging it with a purpose built application is a much better solution. Sanctuary's sole focus is on building roots in tanglibe connections with people. Features such as built in icebreakers to ease the tension and get you talking, or one conversation at a time, allow you to focus on your potential SO. Really get to know them, build authentic relationships. </p>

							<h2>Easy to Setup and Fine-tune</h2>
							<p>Our onboarding process is simple and short. We ask a few questions to see how you sway, and then you're all set and ready to meet the partner of your dreams. If you think you sway a little different then the rest, don't worry, we have options no matter what your preferences are (as long as they are legal). We just want you to get out there and connecting with your new life partner. And if your preferences change over time, we can also accomodate this, and you can change them in settings.</p>
